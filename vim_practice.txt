# Welcome to your Vim practice file!
# Below are some lines to help you practice basic Vim movements and commands.

# Try moving around using normal mode keys: 
# h (left), l (right), j (down), k (up)

This is the first line of the file.
This is the second line of the file.
This is the third line of the file.
This is the fourth line of the file.

# Try jumping to the beginning (0) and end ($) of lines.
# Example: Move to this line and press 0 to go to the start, $ to go to the end.

# Now, try using e (move to the end of the word) and b (move back to the beginning of a word).
# Navigate through the words in this sentence and practice.

# Use gg to jump to the top of the file and G to jump to the bottom.
# Try them out now!

# Try entering visual mode with v, and select some text.
# You can cut (d) or copy (y) the selected text and paste it somewhere else (p).

# Insert mode practice: Move to any line, press 'i' to enter insert mode, and type away!
# Remember, you can always press ESC to go back to normal mode.

# Extra commands:
# :q to quit, :q! to quit without saving, :wq! to save and quit.
# Undo with 'u' and redo with ctrl + r.
# Use / followed by a search term to find text in the file.

# Go to a specific line with :line_number (e.g., :5 to go to line 5).
